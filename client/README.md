# Addventures

Welcome to Addventures!

Addventures is a gamified math learning application for kids.

We started with a problem: Math isn't fun - but it's important! How might we make math exciting and engaging for kids?

We conducted user interviews with kids in the preschool age range. Some insights we came away with were:
- Place rankings like first, second & so on, feel better than having "winners" and "losers"
- Competition can feel good because you get to celebrate others
- Too much external input can feel overwhelming

This project was created as part of [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly)'s Spring 2023 Hackathon. The theme was "Gamification".

## Getting Started

Note that both the front-end and back-end are included in this [mono-repo](https://github.com/TannerEsch/Addventures).

The front-end is in `/client`.

The back-end is in `/server`.

### Wireframes + ERD
- [Figma Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/c4pwe7VldO8a8KCT7BUmVT/Addventures?node-id=32-399&t=tmhsTpP1d6yy1L1K-0)
- [ERD on Lucid](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/c10a82ca-8afb-4308-9a33-f938932c9e5c/edit?invitationId=inv_cec4e048-e08f-4f23-a2ac-30ced984af86&page=0_0#)

### Installation

Steps to install the project on a local machine.

- Fork and clone the repo

In your terminal:
While in the client directory, run
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

While in the server directory, run
- `npm i`
- `nodemon`

## Usage

Both the front-end and back-end must be running to load the app localy. 
You will also need to setup your own SQL server, and modify the back-end code to point to that server.

To side-step that, you can navigate directly to pages in the location bar of your browser:
- `'/level1'`
- `'/worlds'`
This method may cause some assets (images) to not load property.
